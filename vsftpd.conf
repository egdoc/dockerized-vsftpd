# If enabled, vsftpd will run in standalone mode. This means that vsftpd must
# not be run from an inetd of some kind. Instead, the vsftpd executable is run
# once directly. vsftpd itself will then take care of listening for and handling
# incoming connections. Default: NO
listen=YES

# When enabled, and vsftpd is started in "listen" mode, vsftpd will background
# the listener process. i.e. control will immediately be returned to the shell
# which launched vsftpd. Default: (yes)
background=NO

# Allow anonymous FTP? (Disabled by default).
anonymous_enable=NO

# Uncomment this to allow the anonymous FTP user to upload files. This only
# has an effect if the above global write enable is activated. Also, you will
# obviously need to create a directory writable by the FTP user.

# Note! This option only has an effect for non-PAM builds of vsftpd. If disabled,
# vsftpd will not check /etc/shells for a valid user shell for local logins.
# Default: YES
check_shell=NO

# This option is useful is conjunction with virtual users. It is used to
# automatically generate a home directory for each virtual user, based on a
# template. For example, if the home directory of the real user specified via
# guest_username is /home/virtual/$USER, and user_sub_token is set to $USER,
# then when virtual user fred logs in, he will end up (usually chroot()'ed) in
# the directory /home/virtual/fred. This option also takes affect if local_root
# contains user_sub_token.

# directory. If chroot_local_user is YES, then this list becomes a list of

# You may activate the "-R" option to the builtin ls. This is disabled by
# default to avoid remote users being able to cause excessive I/O on large
